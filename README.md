#Cast Iron Games Website debuting Fiskur
Began Winterm of 2019 & actively maintained thru Summer of 2020 as part of GDD Capstone @UW-Stout
Idea behind the site was to make a simple, yet robust, mobile friendly, one of a kind site
using vanilla JS, CSS, HTML, Google Analytics, & doing research into SSO in order to market ourselves fully.
Biggest challenge in the site was the optimization that came with the site, namely the landing page
and blogs page as they both were video and image heavy, respectively.
